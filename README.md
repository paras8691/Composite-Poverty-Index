# Multidimensional Poverty Prediction & Policy Simulation Dashboard
This project builds a data-driven system to analyze multidimensional poverty across Indian states using socio-economic indicators.
The system predicts SDG poverty scores, detects anomalies, and provides policy simulation tools for decision-makers.

The dashboard allows interactive exploration of poverty indicators and enables users to simulate policy interventions.

# Project Overview
Poverty is a multidimensional issue influenced by education, health, financial inclusion, sanitation, and employment.

This project builds a machine learning system that:

• Predicts poverty-related SDG scores for Indian states
• Detects anomalies between actual and predicted outcomes
• Classifies states into poverty risk categories
• Provides policy simulation tools to test potential improvements
• Visualizes poverty risk geographically across India

# Dataset
The dataset contains socio-economic indicators for Indian states.

Features used in the model include:

- Literacy Rate
- Average Monthly Per Capita Consumption Expenditure (MPCE)
- Unemployment Rate
- Infant Mortality Rate (IMR)
- Secondary School Dropout Rate
- Sanitation Access
- Nutrition Stunting
- Bank Account Access
- Target variable:

SDG Poverty Target Score

# Machine Learning Model
The model used in this project is:

AdaBoost Regressor

The model predicts poverty scores based on socio-economic indicators and evaluates prediction errors to identify anomalies.

# Dashboard Features
The interactive Streamlit dashboard provides the following capabilities:

## State-Level Analysis
Users can select any Indian state to view:

- Actual poverty score
- Predicted poverty score
- Risk classification
- Anomaly detection
# Policy Simulation Engine
Users can simulate policy improvements by adjusting:

- Literacy Rate
- Sanitation Access
- Bank Account Access
The system recalculates the predicted poverty score based on the new values.

# Feature Importance Analysis
The dashboard shows which indicators most influence poverty outcomes.

Example insights:

Financial inclusion (Bank Account Access)
Health indicators (Infant Mortality Rate)
Consumption expenditure levels

# Poverty Risk Map
The dashboard includes a choropleth map of India showing:

- High Risk States
- Medium Risk States
- Low Risk States
This enables quick geographical understanding of poverty risk distribution.

# Anomaly Detection
States with large gaps between predicted and actual scores are flagged for further policy investigation.

# Technologies Used
Python
Streamlit
Scikit-learn
Pandas
Matplotlib
Plotly
